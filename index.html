                    Hello! My name is Harrison Reich. I am 23 years old born and raised in southern California. I have a bachelors degree in environmental design and am now pursuing an education in computer science. I like to snowboard, play sports, spend time with my family as well as friends, and hanging out with my pet dog. Welcome to my page, here you can find my work as well as how to get in contact with me. Take a look around!

                    <br>
                    I started off wanting to pursue a career in graphic design. I was studying graphic design for 2 years while attending Arizona State University but changed majors to environmental design. In graphic design we studied color theory and modeled the class off of Swiss and Dutch design principals. In environmental design, we studied the environment and how people operate within it, as well as created three-dimensional models via modeling programs. Now I am learning how to code so that I can create websites and other amazing things with the previous skills I have acquired!
